## Features  
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Detect objects in a webcam feed with bounding boxes and labels.  
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Uses the YOLOv5s model for efficient processing.  
- **Extensible**: Can be adapted for use cases like surveillance, assistive technology, or research purposes.
